If you do not have Java 11, you can download Java 11 by following the guide below:
- [Windows](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html#GUID-A7E27B90-A28D-4237-9383-A58B416071CA)

> **ℹ️ Note:**
> In this installation guide, you'll see the term "JDK" being used. Don't worry! JDK stands for "Java Development Kit", and you can treat it as the same as Java!
3. Download the latest `taskwise.jar` from [this page](https://github.com/orgs/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T17-1/packages?repo_name=tp/latest).
4. Drag and drop the file from your computer's downloads into any folder you want.
5. Open up the [terminal](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac) (Mac) or [command prompt](https://support.kaspersky.com/common/windows/14637#block0) (Windows).
6. Type `cd` followed by the directory path to the folder where you have downloaded TaskWise to navigate there and press `Enter`. For example, if you have downloaded TaskWise to your desktop, you can type the following command:
```
cd ~/Desktop
```
7. Use the command `java -jar taskwise.jar` to get the application running.

## Adding Your First Task

[[Jump to Quick Start Guide]](#quick-start-guide)

Firstly, let's begin by adding a new task to TaskWise! Tasks are completable objectives with or without deadlines. They form the basis for which you can begin your project management journey with TaskWise.

Within the window, left-click on the text box highlighted in the following image, and key in the command `add \t Complete CS2103T User Guide \d 01-01-2023` into the text box, before clicking on the "Enter" or "Return" key.

![image](gui_1.png)

This adds a task with the title `Complete CS2103T User Guide` and the deadline is set to `01-01-2023`. Any task created by you are set as incomplete by default.

If successful, you should be able to see the following task entry on your window!

![image](gui_2.png)

Congratulations! You have just added your first task to track into TaskWise!

## Mark Your First Task as Complete

[[Jump to Quick Start Guide]](#quick-start-guide)

After working on the task for a few days, you realise that your group has finally completed it. Now, it's time for you to mark this task as complete on TaskWise!

To mark a task as complete, key in the command `mark \n 1` in the text box, before clicking on the "Enter" or "Return" key.

![image](gui_2.png)

This command allows you to mark an **incomplete** task as complete! In this case, `1` represents the task number of the task in your task list; since there is only one task in your task list, the value `1` represents the task which you have created previously.

If the command is executed successfully, you should be able to see this on your window!

![image](gui_3.png)

You have just marked your first task as complete in TaskWise! Good job!

## Mark Your First Task as Incomplete

[[Jump to Quick Start Guide]](#quick-start-guide)

All is well, until you realise that your forgetful teammate did not add their part of the documentation into the User Guide! Oh no! You need to now mark the task back to incomplete while the new changes to the documentation are being reviewed.

To mark as task as incomplete, key in the command `unmark \n 1` in the text box, before clicking on the "Enter" or "Return" key.

![image](gui_2.png)

This command allows you to mark a **complete** task as incomplete! In this case, `1` represents the task number of the task in your task list; since there is only one task in your task list, the value `1` represents the task which you have created previously.

If the command is executed successfully, you should be able to see this on your window!

![image](gui_3.png)

Amazing! You have just learnt how you can mark a previously completed task as incomplete!

## Delete Your First Task

[[Jump to Quick Start Guide]](#quick-start-guide)

After a week of hard work, you and your team have decided that work on the User Guide is complete. You realise that there is no need to keep the task in TaskWise, and would like to remove it from your task list permanently.

To delete a task, key in the command `delete \n 1` in the text box, before clicking on the "Enter" or "Return" key.

![image](gui_2.png)

This command allows you to delete any task in your task list! In this case, `1` represents the task number of the task in your task list; since there is only one task in your task list, the value `1` represents the task which you have created previously.

If the command is executed successfully, you should be able to see this on your window!
