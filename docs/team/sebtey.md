## Project Name: TaskWise
TaskWise is a task managing application used by CS2103/T task managers.
The user interacts with it via the Command Line Interface (CLI) and it has a Graphical User
Interface (GUI) made using JavaFX. It is written in Java, and it has about _______ LoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature: Completion Status of task**
  * What it does: It shows the project manager whether the specific task is completed or incomplete.
  * Justifications: The project manager would wish to keep track of which task are completed and which are incomplete, 
  to improve project management.
  * Highlights: This mainly affects the Task Model and requires updates to be made to the TaskListCard fxml file.
* **New Feature: Assigning members to task**
  * What it does: It allows the project manager to assign fellow members to specific tasks.
  * Justifications: In a group project, keeping track of who is doing whichever tasks helps the project manager to
  ensure that the respective assignees stay accountable for the completion of that task. It also helps reduce possible
  confusions on the ground as to who is doing what, improving the experience project management using TaskWise.
  * Highlights: This mainly affects the Task Model and requires updates to be made to the TaskListCard fxml file.
